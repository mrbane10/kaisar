👋 Hi there! I'm Kaisar Imtiyaz, a Machine Learning enthusiast and a B.Tech student at IIT Kharagpur in Mechanical Engineering. My journey in technology has led me to specialize in NLP, Computer Vision, and LLM Fine-tuning, with hands-on experience in building solutions for real-world applications.

🌍 During my internship at Gupshup, I fine-tuned large language models on Indic language datasets, developing tools for multilingual QA in Urdu and Hinglish. As a Teaching Assistant at UNP, I enjoyed guiding students through Python for Data Science, emphasizing core libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

🚀 I've worked on several exciting projects:

A RAG-powered chatbot for course-specific queries using video transcripts and textbooks.
An AI tool for resume screening designed to detect potential fraud by analyzing recommendation patterns.
A PDF Chatbot enabling real-time document Q&A with Hugging Face embeddings.
💼 Skills include Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, Streamlit, Azure, and Hugging Face Transformers. I thrive on creating solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical applications.

📫 Feel free to connect with me here or explore my projects to see my work in NLP, Computer Vision, and more!
